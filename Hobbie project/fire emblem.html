<h1>How I got into Fire Emblem</h1>

I started playing the Fire Emblem franchise since fire emblem 14 (commonly known as Fire Emblem Fates) came out in June 2015. I asked my dad if he could get me a copy of FE 14. The next day he gave me a copy of Fire Emblem Awakening (FE 13). When I started playing it, I quickly realized that the game is harder than I expected it to be. By the time I beat the game, I taught myself everything there was to know about the game. I ended up being addicted to this type of turn based strategy. I'm currently going through FE 16 (Fire Emblem Three Houses) and its four different routes.

While the game tells you how to play, it doesn't always express the importance of some of the game mechanics clearly.

An example of one of these important mechanics that has been a core part of Fire Emblem Since the first game of the franchise is the battle forecast sysstem.

 This mechanic shows up when you want to confirm an attack on your turn. It shows you how much damage you and the enemy will deal. It also shows you the hit rate in other words, it tells you how high of a chance you have of actually hitting the enemy with a percentage. Lastly it also shows you how likely your attack will be a critical attack, dealing triple the damage. One last thing, In the picture above you can see that there is a blue arrow with a X2 in it. This tells you you have a high enough speed stat to attack twice in that specific battle.
